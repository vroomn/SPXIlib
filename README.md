# What is SPXI
SPXI is a (poorly) designed implementaion of an image file format, psuedo designed for games using pixel art and similar applications.
## Core Ideals
### Easy to use
A basic format only needs a basic interface methodology, so there are limited functions you need to use, ideally only two: read and write an image.
### Simple
The underling structure of the file is easy to digest, very similar to bitmap images. I want this to be a bridge between the simplicity of
bitmaps and the power of formats like PNG.  
Also, it's "not just an exe", but I hope it to be easy to compile (or modify the compile step).
### Small
I love small formats, so this one might as well try to minimze the impact it has on disk.
